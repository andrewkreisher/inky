# Inky (client)

See the root-level README for full architecture, networking, and contributor guidance:

- Open `../README.md` from this folder, or from the repository root.

Quick dev:
- `npm run dev` (from this directory) to start the Vite dev server
- Server must also be running from repo root: `npm run server`
